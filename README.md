## Contribution

The repo is just a collection of papers, essays, books which I personally think that they are extremely significant to my understanding of software engineering. The reason I create the list was inspired by the Awesome Community. But this list is going to be maintained mainly by myself. If anyone is interested to contribute, I'd be happy to merge a PR after I read the content which is submited. But at the same time, I would reject if I don't think the content is that meaningful for me. Like I mentioned before, the list is mainly for my personal reference.
